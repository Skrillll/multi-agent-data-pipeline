# multi-agent-data-pipeline
This project creates a multi-agent system to automate data extraction from pipelines. Using the Transformers library, it implements specialized agents for tasks such as web scraping, API retrieval and database queries. A central agent coordinates their actions, and the system is modular to easily integrate new agents.
